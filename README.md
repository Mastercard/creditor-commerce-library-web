## Overview <a name="overview"></a>
As part of Account-to-Account Commerce (AtoAC) product, this library provides the ability for a Debtor to initiate Payment request and agreement request journeys from the Creditorâ€™s Web Application. Creditor Commerce Library facilitates this payment ability for Debtors. It can be integrated on any Web application by following a few simple steps. The library enables Creditor to get details of banks/DSP and to invoke the bank apps using the library.
If the Debtor Service Provider (banking) app is not available, the library enables the debtor/consumer to complete the payment and linking journeys seamlessly through net-banking on the device browser if the Debtor Service Provider (bank) supports it.


## Integration and Usage <a name="usage"></a>
